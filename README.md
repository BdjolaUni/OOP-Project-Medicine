# OOP-Project-Medicine
My oop project, if you are my OOP professor, please check it
Hello, im Shenhur Kyrylo, glad that you spend your time checking my work.
The project itself is a little minigame in which you are plaing as a Doctor that consulting patients remotely.
(Because topic was medicine)
In project i tried to use as much knowledge from this course as i can remember at the moment of writing the code itself.
I still havent learned how to deal with git, for which i apologize, but using #ifdef i saved all versions of my project,
and they all are testable!
